## Task description

### The purpose of the task is to test the programmer's ability to.
1. The structure of the solution
2. The modularity of the solution
3. Documentation (comments and user documentation)

### Requirements
1. programming language Java
2. framework and development environment not essential
3. any database (HSQL recommended)
4. the program must work

### Task description
1. Web application in which you can manage a tree structure
2. Graphical components are irrelevant (design follows functionality)
3. The tree structure should be modifiable without restrictions
4. Nodes must be editable
5. Numbers can be stored in nodes
6. Leaves should present sums from all nodes on the way to the root
7. functions to implement on the tree:
    * Edit (CRUD - create, read, change and delete) nodes and leaves
